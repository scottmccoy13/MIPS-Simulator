# MIPS-Simulator
The purpose of this project is to simulate the execution of a 32 bit MIPS I assembly language
program given in binary format. This program will provide different modes that the MIPS code
can be executed in (i.e. line by line, multiple lines, full program) as well as a GUI to show
the current state of each register.


The formatting of the different types of instructions are given by the following table.

<table class="wikitable">
<tbody><tr>
<th>Type</th>
<th colspan="6">-31- &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; format (bits) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -0-</th>
</tr>
<tr align="center">
<td><b>R</b></td>
<td>opcode (6)</td>
<td>rs (5)</td>
<td>rt (5)</td>
<td>rd (5)</td>
<td>shamt (5)</td>
<td>funct (6)</td>
</tr>
<tr align="center">
<td><b>I</b></td>
<td>opcode (6)</td>
<td>rs (5)</td>
<td>rt (5)</td>
<td colspan="3">immediate (16)</td>
</tr>
<tr align="center">
<td><b>J</b></td>
<td>opcode (6)</td>
<td colspan="5">address (26)</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

The end goal of the project will be to implement each of the instructions listed at
